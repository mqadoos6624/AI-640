To Run the Game:
      Enter -->  
      
            Python Flappy_Bird_DQN.py -m "Run".
            
      This will start the game on already trained model which is named as "model.h5".
      
But if you want to train the model from again from scratch. First delete "model.h5" file and then:
      Enter -->
      
            Python Flappy_Bird_DQN.py -m "Train"
      
      This will create a new model.h5 after done with traning (it will take time), then we can test the model performace.
